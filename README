Apollo RP is a plugin set for AMX Mod X. It was designed to be modular, easy
to use, fast, efficient and easy to expand upon. It features many design
improvements to overcome problems in Harbu RP, which it was based on
(though it shares no code with).

This is a complete project and is no longer being developed, though is
still supported and being maintained.
