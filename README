NOTE: Actual source code is always located in a "scripting" folder. For
example, "./addons/amxmodx/scripting"

Root folders:
"base" - This contains all base plugins that are built into Apollo RP's main
package.
"extra" - All plugins I wrote over time to add additional functionality but
which I didn't feel were suitable to be part of the base package.

Apollo RP is a plugin set for AMX Mod X. It was designed to be modular, easy
to use, fast, efficient and easy to expand upon. It features many design
improvements to overcome problems in Harbu RP, which it was based on
(though it shares no code with).

This is a complete project and is no longer being developed, though is
still supported and being maintained.
