      <li><u>04/23/2012</u>: The host of the server that ApolloRP.org was on was 
      attacked several days ago, and unfortunately everything was lost. No backups
      are available as I lost them last time we switched servers, which was 
      fairly recently, and I didn't get a chance to get automatic backups 
      started again. For the record, we had something like 500 members, 20,000 
      posts and have existed since 2006.</li>

    <div class="title">Apollo RP</div>
    <p>Apollo RP is a mod for Half-Life which modifies the game world to be closer 
    to a role-playing game. That is, it establishes a virtual economy, allows 
    players to use items that have real effects in the game, and other things 
    that make the game more than just a first-person shooter.</p>
    <div class="title">Features</div>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Economy</b> - Features a fully functional economy, with the ability 
      to manage items and money in a virtual game world.</li>
      <li><b>Non-Player Characters (NPCs)</b> - Characters with AI who 
      participate in the game environment can be added onto a map to enhance the 
      experience and make items and services available to players.</li>
      <li><b>Properties and Residences</b> - A large system exists to allow 
      players to own properties that they can manage and give people access to. 
      Every door to a property is independently managed, and keys can be given 
      to any trusted friends. Properties can range from anything from a gang's 
      hideout to an apartment.</li>
      <li><b>Jobs</b> - Players can either automatically get a job or be 
      assigned one by an admin. A job can just be a title, or it can be 
      something a player actually has to go do. They are paid an adjustable 
      salary at a regular interval.</li>
      <li><b>Realism</b> - Some realism features exist as part of the base 
      package, such as hunger and the need to satisfy it with food items. Others 
      realism features are available through plugins written for Apollo RP.</li>
      <li><b>Access Control</b> - A fully functional in-game administration 
      system exists. This can be used to restrict access to players for certain 
      features and abilities. This access control system can also be used to 
      automatically give all members of an organization access to a property, 
      among many other things.</li>
      <li><b>Robbing</b> - A full system for simulating robberies of non-player
      characters exists. This system can also be extended to do other things as 
      it is extremely flexible. For example, it can be scripted to act as a 
      house alarm or a disco ball.</li> 
      <li><b>Jail Mod and Cuffing</b> - Players can be subdued by police and 
      thrown in jail. This opens up chances for roleplaying, and creates a 
      greater sense of realism with a more clearly defined cost-reward of any 
      activity, especially illegal ones.</li>
      <li><b>Saving to SQL</b> - Everything is saved to SQL, so if a server 
      crashes or goes down, it can easily return to where it was. Servers can 
      also easily be linked so that they run on the same economy but different 
      maps.</li>
      <li><b>... and best of all, a great API</b> - The most notable part of 
      Apollo RP is its extensive API. Almost every function within it is exposed 
      to plugins so that they can alter or extend functionality.
